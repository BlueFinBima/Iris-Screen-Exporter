# IRIS Screen Exporter Change Log
## 1.0.2020.0531
1. Changed build to Any CPU to allow to be installed on 32 bit systems which might be running clients for a single screen.  This means that on 64 bit systems, it could be installed in Program Files(x86) now.
2. Moved the installation out of the "IRIS" sub directory
3. Improved and corrected the error messages for network errors and "Message Too Large" in particular.
4. Installation default is now just for the current user rather than all users.
